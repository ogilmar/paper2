**Title**: Anxiety-associated behavior and genotoxicity found in adult Danio rerio exposed to tebuconazole-based commercial product.

**Abstract**:
The effects of different concentrations of commercial product based on tebuconazole, on adults of Danio rerio, were evaluated through novel tank diving test and micronucleus and comet assay tests. A total of 320 adult D. rerio were divided into eight tanks and exposed to concentrations of 0; 100; 200 and 300 μg/L the commercial product based on tebuconazole, with their respective replicates at 24, 72 and 96 h. The results showed a behavioral deviation of zebrafish and a significant (p < 0.05) increase in DNA damage as a function of exposed time and different concentrations of the commercial product in relation to the negative control. The results obtained in this study allow to conclude that tebuconazole has effects on adults of Danio rerio, inducing genotoxicity and mutagenicity, as well as altering neurological functions related to the change in the behavior of adults.
